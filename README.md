# description:
Given a set of process bursts and IO time it would take for each we had to create a Multi-Level-Feedback-Queue scheduler and a first-come-first-serve scheduler.  These bursts are all introduced to the system at the same time and the scheduler must sort and process them based on the rules of the scheduler. It will also calculate total time, CPU utilization, response time, turnaround time, wait time and their averages.

# Instillation:
Simply open the .cpp file in a compatible complier and run it.
