# Description:
Given a set of processes with assigned burst times, it would take for each we had to create a Multi-Level-Feedback-Queue scheduler and a first-come-first-serve scheduler.  These bursts are all introduced to the system at the same time and the scheduler must sort and process them based on the rules of the scheduler. The system displays the process queue and IO time after every step. When completed it displays: CPU utilization, response times with an average, turnaround times with an average, and wait times with an average
